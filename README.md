In this project, we have first scraped almost 20 hyperlinks of the product using BS4. After scraping, we hit each link to get the products links and details.

## PART 1
---

In Part 1, we have to scrape 
- Product URL
- Product Name
- Product Price
- Rating
- Number of reviews

Product URL's were scraped from the webpages. Rest of the details were scraped while hitting each URL with the functions we created in Part 1 .

## PART 2
---

In Part 2, we have to scrape
- Description
- ASIN
- Product Description
- Manufacturer

Regular Expression(re) was used to get the ASIN number from Product URLs. Rest of the details were scraped while hitting each URL with the functions we creted in Part 2. 

Lastly we have exported the data to csv file using Pandas.
